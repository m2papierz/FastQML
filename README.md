# FastQML

The premise of the project is to create a Python library based on existing open-source libraries like Pennylane, JAX, 
and PyTorch to enable users to implement Quantum Machine Learning (QML) models for research and benchmarking easily and 
in a scalable manner. The library will be based on a strong assumption of optimization on both CPU (primarily) and GPU 
(subsequent phase) and give access to ready-made implementations of various QML architectures and their flexible 
modification.
